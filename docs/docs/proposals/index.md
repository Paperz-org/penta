# Enhancement Proposals

Enhancement Proposals are a formal way of proposing large feature additions to the **Penta Framework**.

You can create a proposal by making a pull request with a new page under [`docs/proposals`](https://github.com/paperz-org/penta/tree/master/docs/docs/proposals), or by creating an [issue on github](https://github.com/paperz-org/penta/issues).

Please see the current proposals:
